# Hurricane Analysis

#### Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.
#### Project Goals
You will work to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements.
#### Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, you should have completed the Loops and Dictionaries sections of the [Learn Python 3 Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). This content is also covered in the [Data Scientist Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science/).
## Project Requirements
1. Hurricanes, also known as cyclones or typhoons, are one of the most powerful forces of nature on Earth. Due to climate change caused by human activity, the number and intensity of hurricanes has risen, calling for better preparation by the many communities that are devastated by them. As a concerned environmentalist, you want to look at data about the most powerful hurricanes that have occured. 

   Begin by looking at the `damages` list. The list contains strings representing the total cost in USD(`$`) caused by `34` category 5 hurricanes (wind speeds $\ge$ 157 mph (252 km/h)) in the Atlantic region. For some of the hurricanes, damage data was not recorded (`"Damages not recorded"`), while the rest are written in the format `"Prefix-B/M"`, where `B` stands for billions (`1000000000`) and `M` stands for millions (`1000000`).
   
   Write a function that returns a new list of updated damages where the recorded data is converted to float values and the missing data is retained as `"Damages not recorded"`.
   
   Test your function with the data stored in `damages`.
damages = ['Damages not recorded', '100M', 'Damages not recorded', '40M',
           '27.9M', '5M', 'Damages not recorded', '306M', '2M', '65.8M',
           '326M', '60.3M', '208M', '1.42B', '25.4M', 'Damages not recorded',
           '1.54B', '1.24B', '7.1B', '10B', '26.5B', '6.2B', '5.37B', '23.3B',
           '1.01B', '125B', '12B', '29.4B', '1.76B', '720M', '15.1B', '64.8B',
           '91.6B', '25.1B']

def convert_damages_data(damages):
    """Convert damages data from string to float and return converted data as a list."""
    conversion = {"M": 1000000,  # <--- HERE: conversion is defined INSIDE the function
                  "B": 1000000000}

    updated_damages = []

    for damage in damages:
        if damage == "Damages not recorded":
            updated_damages.append(damage)
        elif 'M' in damage:
            updated_damages.append(float(damage[:-1]) * conversion["M"]) #Uses conversion
        elif 'B' in damage:
            updated_damages.append(float(damage[:-1]) * conversion["B"]) #Uses conversion
        else:
            print(f"I don't know how to convert {damage}")

    return updated_damages

updated_damages = convert_damages_data(damages)
print(updated_damages)
2. Additional data collected on the `34` strongest Atlantic hurricanes are provided in a series of lists. The data includes:
   - `names`: names of the hurricanes
   - `months`: months in which the hurricanes occurred
   - `years`: years in which the hurricanes occurred
   - `max_sustained_winds`: maximum sustained winds (miles per hour) of the hurricanes
   - `areas_affected`: list of different areas affected by each of the hurricanes
   - `deaths`: total number of deaths caused by each of the hurricanes
   
   The data is organized such that the data at each index, from `0` to `33`, corresponds to the same hurricane.
   
   For example, `names[0]` yields the "Cuba I" hurricane, which occurred in `months[0]` (October) `years[0]` (1924).
   
   Write a function that constructs a dictionary made out of the lists, where the keys of the dictionary are the names of the hurricanes, and the values are dictionaries themselves containing a key for each piece of data (`Name`, `Month`, `Year`, `Max Sustained Wind`, `Areas Affected`, `Damage`, `Death`) about the hurricane.
   
   Thus the key `"Cuba I"` would have the value: `{'Name': 'Cuba I', 'Month': 'October', 'Year': 1924, 'Max Sustained Wind': 165, 'Areas Affected': ['Central America', 'Mexico', 'Cuba', 'Florida', 'The Bahamas'], 'Damage': 'Damages not recorded', 'Deaths': 90}`.
   
   Test your function on the lists of data provided.

# damages (USD($)) of hurricanes
damages = ['Damages not recorded', '100M', 'Damages not recorded', '40M', '27.9M', '5M', 'Damages not recorded', '306M', '2M', '65.8M', '326M', '60.3M', '208M', '1.42B', '25.4M', 'Damages not recorded', '1.54B', '1.24B', '7.1B', '10B', '26.5B', '6.2B', '5.37B', '23.3B', '1.01B', '125B', '12B', '29.4B', '1.76B', '720M', '15.1B', '64.8B', '91.6B', '25.1B']

# deaths for each hurricane
deaths = [90,4000,16,3103,179,184,408,682,5,1023,43,319,688,259,37,11,2068,269,318,107,65,19325,51,124,17,1836,125,87,45,133,603,138,3057,74]

# 2
# Create a Table
def create_dictionary(names, months, years, max_sustained_winds, areas_affected, updated_damages, deaths):
    """Create dictionary of hurricanes with hurricane name as the key and a dictionary of hurricane data as the value."""
    hurricanes = dict()
    num_hurricanes = len(names)
    for i in range(num_hurricanes):
        hurricanes[names[i]] = {"Name": names[i],
                              "Month": months[i],
                              "Year": years[i],
                              "Max Sustained Wind": max_sustained_winds[i],

                              "Deaths": deaths[i]}
    return hurricanes

# Create and view the hurricanes dictionary
hurricanes = create_dictionary(names, months, years, max_sustained_winds, areas_affected, updated_damages, deaths)
print(hurricanes)
print(damages)

3. In addition to organizing the hurricanes in a dictionary with names as the key, you want to be able to organize the hurricanes by year.

   Write a function that converts the current dictionary of hurricanes to a new dictionary, where the keys are years and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that occurred in that year.
   
   For example, the key `1932` would yield the value: `[{'Name': 'Bahamas', 'Month': 'September', 'Year': 1932, 'Max Sustained Wind': 160, 'Areas Affected': ['The Bahamas', 'Northeastern United States'], 'Damage': 'Damage not recorded', 'Deaths': 16}, {'Name': 'Cuba II', 'Month': 'November', 'Year': 1932, 'Max Sustained Wind': 175, 'Areas Affected': ['Lesser Antilles', 'Jamaica', 'Cayman Islands', 'Cuba', 'The Bahamas', 'Bermuda'], 'Damage': 40000000.0, 'Deaths': 3103}]`.
   
   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
def for in 

# 3
# Organizing by Year
def create_year_dictionary(hurricanes):
    """Convert dictionary with hurricane name as key to a new dictionary with hurricane year as the key and return new dictionary."""
    
    hurricanes_by_year = dict()
    for cane in hurricanes:
        current_year = hurricanes[cane]['Year']
        current_cane = hurricanes[cane]
        if current_year not in hurricanes_by_year:
            hurricanes_by_year[current_year] = [current_cane]
        else:
            hurricanes_by_year[current_year].append(current_cane)
    return hurricanes_by_year

# Create new dictionary of hurricanes organized by year
hurricanes_by_year = create_year_dictionary(hurricanes)
print(hurricanes_by_year[2018])

4. You believe that knowing how often each of the areas of the Atlantic are affected by these strong hurricanes is important for making preparations for future hurricanes.

   Write a function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane. Store and return the results in a dictionary where the keys are the affected areas and the values are counts of how many times the areas were affected.
   
   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
# 4
# Counting Damaged Areas
def count_areas_affected(hurricanes):
    affected_areas_count = dict()
    for cane in hurricanes:
        for area in hurricanes[cane]['Areas Affected']:
            if area not in affected_areas_count:
                affected_areas_count[area] = 1
            else:
                affected_areas_count[area] += 1
    return affected_areas_count
    
# create dictionary of areas to store the number of hurricanes involved in
affected_areas_count = count_areas_affected(hurricanes)
print(affected_areas_count)
5. Write a function that finds the area affected by the most hurricanes, and how often it was hit.

   Test your function on your affected area dictionary.
# 5
# Calculating Maximum Hurricane Count
def create_max_hurricane_count(hurricanes):
# find most frequently affected area and the number of hurricanes involved in

def create_max_hurricane_count(affected_areas_count):
    """Find most frequently affected area and the number of hurricanes involved."""
    max_area = ''
    max_count = 0
    
    for area, count in affected_areas_count.items():
        if count > max_count:
            max_area = area
            max_count = count
            
    return max_area, max_count

# Get the area most affected by hurricanes
max_area, max_count = create_max_hurricane_count(affected_areas_count)
print(f"{max_area} was hit by {max_count} hurricanes")
6. Write a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest number of deaths, and how many deaths it caused.

   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
# 6
# Calculating the Deadliest Hurricane
def create_max_death_count(hurricanes):
    """ find the hurricane that caused the maximum number of deaths """
    death_count = ''
    max_death_count = 0
    
    for cane in hurricanes:
        if hurricanes[cane]['Deaths'] > max_death_count:
            death_count = cane
            max_death_count = hurricanes[cane]['Deaths']
    return death_count, max_death_count
            
        
# find highest mortality hurricane and the number of deaths
death_count, max_death_count = create_max_death_count(hurricanes)
print(f"The hurricane {death_count} caused {max_death_count} deaths")
7. Just as hurricanes are rated by their windspeed, you want to try rating hurricanes based on other metrics.

   Write a function that rates hurricanes on a mortality scale according to the following ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of deaths for that rating.
   
   ```py
   mortality_scale = {0: 0,
   1: 100,
   2: 500,
   3: 1000,
   4: 10000}
   ```
   
   For example, a hurricane with a `1` mortality rating would have resulted in greater than `0` but less than or equal to `100` deaths. A hurricane with a `5` mortality would have resulted in greater than `10000` deaths.
   
   Store the hurricanes in a new dictionary where the keys are the mortaility ratings and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that falls into that mortality rating.
   
   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
# 7
# Rating Hurricanes by Mortality
def create_mortality_scale(hurricanes):
    mortality_scale = {0: 0, 1: 100, 2: 500, 3: 1000, 4: 10000}
    hurricanes_by_mortality = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: []}

    for cane in hurricanes:
        num_deaths = hurricanes[cane]['Deaths']
        if num_deaths == mortality_scale[0]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[0].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif num_deaths > mortality_scale[0] and num_deaths <= mortality_scale[1]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[1].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif num_deaths > mortality_scale[1] and num_deaths <= mortality_scale[2]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[2].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif num_deaths > mortality_scale[2] and num_deaths <= mortality_scale[3]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[3].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif num_deaths > mortality_scale[3] and num_deaths <= mortality_scale[4]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[4].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif num_deaths > mortality_scale[4]:
            hurricanes_by_mortality[5].append(hurricanes[cane])

    return hurricanes_by_mortality

# categorize hurricanes in new dictionary with mortality severity as key
hurricanes_by_mortality = create_mortality_scale(hurricanes)
# Print hurricanes categorized under mortality_scale 4
print(hurricanes_by_mortality[4])
8. Write a function that finds the hurricane that caused the greatest damage, and how costly it was.

   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
# 8
# Calculating Hurricane Maximum Damage
def highest_damage (hurricanes):
    """ find the hurricane that caused the maximum damage """
    damage_count = ''
    max_damage_count = 0
    
    for cane in hurricanes:
        if hurricanes[cane]['Damage'] == 'Damages not recorded':
            continue
        if hurricanes[cane]['Damage'] > max_damage_count:
            damage_count = cane
            max_damage_count = hurricanes[cane]['Damage']
    return damage_count, max_damage_count

# find highest damage inducing hurricane and its total cost
damage_count,max_damage_count = highest_damage(hurricanes)
print(damage_count, max_damage_count)
9. Lastly, you want to rate hurricanes according to how much damage they cause.

   Write a function that rates hurricanes on a damage scale according to the following ratings, where the key is the rating and the value is the upper bound of damage for that rating.
   ```py
   damage_scale = {0: 0,
   1: 100000000,
   2: 1000000000,
   3: 10000000000,
   4: 50000000000}
   ```
   
   For example, a hurricane with a `1` damage rating would have resulted in damages greater than `0` USD but less than or equal to `100000000` USD. A hurricane with a `5` damage rating would have resulted in damages greater than `50000000000` USD (talk about a lot of money).
   
   Store the hurricanes in a new dictionary where the keys are damage ratings and the values are lists containing a dictionary for each hurricane that falls into that damage rating.
   
   Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.
# 9
# Rating Hurricanes by Damage
def cat_by_damage(hurricanes):
    """ categorize hurricanes in new dictionary with damage severity as key """
    damage_scale = {0: 0, 1: 100000000, 2: 1000000000, 3: 10000000000, 4: 50000000000}
    hurricanes_by_damage = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: [], 5: []}

    for cane in hurricanes:
        damage = hurricanes[cane]['Damage']
        if damage == 'Damages not recorded':
            hurricanes_by_damage[0].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif damage > damage_scale[0] and damage <= damage_scale[1]:
            hurricanes_by_damage[1].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif damage > damage_scale[1] and damage <= damage_scale[2]:
            hurricanes_by_damage[2].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif damage > damage_scale[2] and damage <= damage_scale[3]:
            hurricanes_by_damage[3].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif damage > damage_scale[3] and damage <= damage_scale[4]:
            hurricanes_by_damage[4].append(hurricanes[cane])
        elif damage > damage_scale[4]:
            hurricanes_by_damage[5].append(hurricanes[cane])

    return hurricanes_by_damage

# categorize hurricaes in new dictionary with damage severity as key
hurricanes_by_damage = cat_by_damage(hurricanes)
print(hurricanes_by_damage[5])
